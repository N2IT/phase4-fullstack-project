## Git Selective Merge Process
git checkout <branch>
git merge --no-commit --no-ff <branch to be merged>

## Reset specific db files as these do not merge without conflicts
git reset HEAD server/instance/app.db server/config.py server/app.py
git checkout -- server/instance/app.db server/config.py server/app.py

## Complete the merge
git commit -m "Merge <branch that was merged> into <branch> with selective file updates"


## Git delete branch on github
## ONLY after deleting locally
git push origin --delete <branch-name>
